A classification program
------------------------
When you understand what the first three chapters tell, now you can try
this demo program.
Data and file are in https://github.com/Tanbobobo/DL-starter.git.
Extract images from zip files and make data paths.
you can find the paths settings in preprogress.py.
After you figure out the data paths, you can
run python preprogress.py, obatain the training and validation sets
and
python main.py, start your deep learning tour.

Maybe you will have problems in path, array, tensor etc.
Try your best to solve them accroding to Internet :)
